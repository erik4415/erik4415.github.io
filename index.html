      <h2>About</h2>
      <img src="" />
      <p>Hello to one and all.  My name is Erik Hough, incase you didn't notice from the gigantic banner above, and I'm a software developer.  I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2013 and started working as a black box software tester for a healthcare company called Epic.  I quickly started to learn as much about programming as I could, and quickly found a passion for all things software.  I took some classes offered by our company to learn more about coding, and then started taking computer science classes through the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  Within my first year at Epic I transitioned from doing black box QA, to writing set up code for unit tests, along with the actual unit tests, and server side testing scripts.  Soon I was in charge of all automated testing for our team and was helping other teams implement their own automated testing.  Along with this I also did a lot of  devleopement to fix existing bugs, and developed a bunch of new tools to help internal black box QA'ers test more efficiently.  Besides my work experience I have also developed quite a few of my own personal projects, just for fun.  I haven't had the most traditional path to to becoming a software developer, but fortunatley I have had some great opportunites and a passion for making cool stuff.  In my free time I love to hike and generally be active outdoors, I also love to cook and spend time with my dogs (ridiculous pictures below). Your probably sick of hearing about me so take a look at my projects/resume below, hope you enjoy!  </p>

      <h4><a href="http://erik4415.github.io/FindPlaceToLive">Find a Good Neighborhood</a></a></h4>
      <p>This is a website I built using the google maps api to find a good place to live in any city.  I moved a couple of years ago to a new city and had no idea what were safe areas and good neighborhoods were.  I ended up looking at crime statistics for the city which helped oreint me to the city. Unfortunately crime statistic API's differ from state to state and I wanted something that would work anywhere.  This map uses searches of the surrounding area to find business and institutions that correlate with safer areas.  As an example if there is a Whole Foods in your neighborhood, it probably has less crime.  This really more indicates socioeconomic status of the areas, but this was a fun project to play around with and work with googles API's.  After entering a city to search on the map areas in green are more likely to have less crime, and red areas will potentially have more.
      </p>
      <h4><a href="http://google.com/">Audiogram Website</a></a></h4>
      <p>My college degree was in Speech/Language/Hearing sciences, which pretty much leads to either grad school for Speech Pathology or Audiology (Ear Doctor).  I started grad school for Audiology but quickly realized that it wasn't for me.  One of the main assessments in Audiology is using an audiogram to record the hearing levels of a patient.  I created this simple to use online version mainly to practice with javascript, and it allows for a lot easier reading of an audiogram and quick documentation.  Some of my old classmates even started using this during their clinical hours.
      </p>
      <h4><a href="http://countrysidecontractorsmn.com/">Small Business Website</a></a></h4>
      <p>This was actually one of the first websites I ever built.  A family friend was getting complaints from people that they couldn't google him to find the phone number for his company.  Started out as pure and simple html/css, but I have updated it as my skills have improved.  Also worked on getting it indexed by major search engines and making sure the design was professional.

Epic, Madison Wisconsin —Software Test Engineer
September 2015-Present

Started out doing black box testing for Epic (a healthcare software company that provides a full suite of applications for hospitals).  Eventually started to do more technical testing with unit/load testing because of my interest in programming.  Moved to developing internal tools to help black box testers and developers be more efficient and to test things that would be impossible for black box testers.
Led automated testing for the team, which included managing unit testing, creating new unit tests, writing code for setup, ensuring fragile areas were covered with unit tests.
I started to do standard development, mostly fixing bugs across the system.
I also ran the billing integration group within my team which involved triaging of issues, daily SCRUM meetings, and reviewing/creation/requirements  of designs.  
Working in billing daily work often included ensuring our software was in compliance with federal regulations, and special meeting meaningful use which included adhering to usability and user centerted design standards.  I was the lead for ensuring we were compliant with NAIC Regulations

Unit Test Framework — Setup code for unit tests
The team I worked on relied heavily on having pre build records for unit testing.  This was mostly done with static build which meant a lot of manual build whenever we wanted to implement a new test and it wasn’t being used regularly.   I developed routines to dynamically build out the records we needed to do unit testing for new development, and built the api’s so other developers could use them easily.  Our team went from using no unit testing to having almost every new piece of development having unit testing because of the code I developed.
          
Internal Standard Test Cases for new Items — Detail
I helped to automate standard test cases that had formerly been black box tested by qa.  I was able to automate most of the process with 
Various Internal projects at Epic— Detail
Automated test plan generation based on objects attached to log.
Added the ability to search security setting across apps to help with debuging, saved a lot of jumping from screen to screen.
Created a routine to duplicate patients in a realistic way to help with load/utility  testing.
Created a program to calculate the risk of new development based on new lines of code, issues caused by the function being modified before, and general complexity of development.   Before this risk was judged by developers, after I created this it became a standard report for  Managers to plan recources around the risk score my code produced for development.
