      <h2>About</h2>
      <img src="" />
      <p>Hello to one and all.  My name is Erik Hough, in case you didn't notice from the gigantic banner above, and I'm a software developer.  I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2013 and started working as a black box software tester for a healthcare company called Epic.  I quickly started to learn as much about programming as I could, and quickly found a passion for all things software.  I took some classes offered by our company to learn more about coding, and then started taking computer science classes through the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  Within my first year at Epic I transitioned from doing black box QA, to writing set up code for unit tests, along with the actual unit tests, and server side testing scripts.  Soon I was in charge of all automated testing for our team and was helping other teams implement their own automated testing.  Along with this I also did a lot of  development to fix existing bugs, and developed a bunch of new tools to help internal black box QA'ers test more efficiently.  Besides my work experience I have also developed quite a few of my own personal projects, just for fun.  I haven't had the most traditional path to becoming a software developer, but fortunately  I have had some great opportunities  and a passion for making cool stuff.  In my free time I love to hike and generally be active outdoors, I also love to cook and spend time with my dogs (ridiculous pictures below). Your probably sick of hearing about me so take a look at my projects/resume below, hope you enjoy!  </p>

      <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
      <img src="" />
      <h4><a href="http://erik4415.github.io/FindPlaceToLive">Find a Good Neighborhood Website</a></a></h4>
      <p>This is a website I built using the google maps api to find a good place to live in any city.  I moved a couple of years ago to a new city and had no idea what were safe areas and good neighborhoods were.  I ended up looking at crime statistics for the city which helped oreint me to the city. Unfortunately crime statistic API's differ from state to state and I wanted something that would work anywhere.  This map uses searches of the surrounding area to find business and institutions that correlate with safer areas.  As an example if there is a Whole Foods in your neighborhood, it probably has less crime.  This really more indicates socioeconomic status of the areas, but this was a fun project to play around with and work with googles API's.  After entering a city to search on the map areas in green are more likely to have less crime, and red areas will potentially have more.
      </p>
      <h4><a href="https://erik4415.github.io/AudiogramSite/">Audiogram Website</a></a></h4>
      <p>My college degree was in Speech/Language/Hearing sciences, which pretty much leads to either grad school for Speech Pathology or Audiology (Ear Doctor).  I started grad school for Audiology but quickly realized that it wasn't for me.  One of the main assessments in Audiology is using an audiogram to record the hearing levels of a patient.  I created this simple to use online version mainly to practice with javascript, and it allows for a lot easier reading of an audiogram and quick documentation.  Many of the students in the UW Hearing Sciences division started using this during clinical hours to document audiograms.
      </p>
      <h4><a href="http://countrysidecontractorsmn.com/">Small Business Website</a></a></h4>
      <p>This was actually one of the first websites I ever built.  A family friend was getting complaints from people that they couldn't google him to find the phone number for his company.  Started out as pure and simple html/css, but I have updated it as my skills have improved.  Also worked on getting it indexed by major search engines and making sure the design was professional.
          
      <h4>Noteworthy Academic Projects</h4>
<p> <a href="https://github.com/erik4415/WordCloudGenerator">Word Cloud Generator</a> - Created this in my data structures class.  This program takes a text file and finds the most common words in that file, then creates an html file that makes the words bigger based on how many times they appear in the text.  Since this was a class project we were required to use certain data structures, so it is not the most efficient design and uses a combination of priority queues and AST's.  It was an interesting project though and I loved that the end result was something that could be useful.
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://github.com/erik4415/MyLanugage">Custom Programming Language Compiler</a> - Made this as a semester long project for my compiler and programming class.  The syntax is a combination of C and java, and uses the Java VM to compile too.  Main concepts I learned from this indcluded regular expressions, CUP specifications, finite automata, and actual code generation.  Also learned about code optimization at the compiler level and general low level programming concepts.
    <br>
    <br>
    3D Tic Tac Toe - What could make tic tac toe better? Playing it in 3D obviously.  This is a text based tic tac toe game that uses three boards instead of one.  So getting 3 in a row can now involve the extra dimension of backwards and forwards.

<h4>EDUCATION</h4>
<p>University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,MN <i>BA Speech/Hearing Sciences</i> Graduated 2013 <br>This was a heavily Biology/Physiology major that focused on functional hearing and speech related probelms.  My focus was on becoming an audiologist, which I started the doctorate program at UW madison, but after a semester decided that I wasnâ€™t passionate enough to continue another 4 years of school. <br>
    
<p>University of Wisconsin, Madison <br>Programming classes taken while I was working at Epic - These classes were offered </p><p>CS Intro to Programming</p><p>CS 367 Intro to Data Structures</p><p>CS 536 Intro to Programming Languages and Compilers</p>
        
        <h4>PROFESSIONAL PROJECTS</h4><p>Unit Test Framework <i>Setup code for unit tests</i> </p><p>The team I worked on relied heavily on having pre build records for unit testing.  This was mostly done with static build which meant a lot of manual build whenever we wanted to implement a new test and it wasnâ€™t being used regularly.   I developed routines to dynamically build out the records we needed to do unit testing for new development, and built the apiâ€™s so other developers could use them easily.  Our team went from using no unit testing to having almost every new piece of development having unit testing because of the code I developed.</p><p>Internal Standard Test Cases for new Items<br>I helped to automate standard test cases that had formerly been black box tested by qa.  I was able to automate most of the process with </p><p>Automated test plan generation based on objects attached to log.</p><p>Added the ability to search security setting across apps to help with debuging, saved a lot of jumping from screen to screen.</p><p>Created a routine to duplicate patients in a realistic way to help with load/utility  testing.</p><p>Created a program to calculate the risk of new development based on new lines of code, issues caused by the function being modified before, and general complexity of development.   Before this risk was judged by developers, after I created this it became a standard report for  Managers to plan recources around the risk score my code produced for development.</p>
